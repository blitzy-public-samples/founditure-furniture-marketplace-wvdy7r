## Overview

### Introduction
Founditure iOS is a native application built with Swift and SwiftUI, designed to combat urban furniture waste through community-driven recovery efforts. The app enables users to document, discover, and coordinate the recovery of discarded furniture items.

### Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Real-time furniture listing and discovery
- Location-based search and mapping
- In-app messaging system
- Points and achievements system
- AI-powered furniture recognition
- Push notifications
- Offline support

### Requirements
- iOS 14.0 or later
- iPhone and iPad support
- Internet connectivity for real-time features
- Camera access for furniture documentation
- Location services for proximity features
